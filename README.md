# jQuery_Jellyfish_odometer
jQuery plugin creating animated odometer style counters based on my original Jellyfish Odometer Class

Mainly intended for my own use for a future version of the Jellyfish Counter Widget for Wordpress,
but as it's a standalone jQuery plugin it could have countless other uses....

Although the original class was fairly mature and this started as a direct port of it,
there will be plenty of changes coming along when you least expect it.

Use / fork at your own risk :)
